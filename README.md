## General Information
- I took on this project as a hands on way of learning the fundamentals of *ReactJS*.
- I was able to explore various React concepts including *elements*, *components*, *props*, and *state*.


## Technologies Used
- React
- HTML & CSS


## Features
- Lets you play tic-tac-toe.
- Indicates when a player has won the game.
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses.
- Allows players to review a game’s history, see previous versions of a game’s board, and even *go back in time*.


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_.


## Room for Improvement
- Improve the visual design.
- Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
